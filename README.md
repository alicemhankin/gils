- The file **Generalised_Inverse_Limits.pdf** contains my report - "Unions of Generalised Inverse Limits on Set Valued Functions". This was written in 2019/20 for a summer research scholarship at the University of Auckland.

- **Slideshow.pdf** is a slideshow for a 10-minute talk summarising the project. Contains some very cool images made in Inkscape, but may require some topology knowledge to understand!
